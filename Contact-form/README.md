## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Complete the form and see a success toast message upon successful submission
- Receive form validation messages if:
  - A required field has been missed
  - The email address is not formatted correctly
- Complete the form only using their keyboard
- Have inputs, error messages, and the success message announced on their screen reader
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

I thought it would be better to start doing the desktop view first since I knew I can just adjust the flexboxes for the mobile view.

### Built with

- Sass for styling
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### Continued development

Although I didn't add any transitions for the success message, it was something that i was working on. I will apply it to other future projects. My only reason why I did not apply it to this one was because the way i implemented the form, button on submit the radio and checkboxes.

### Useful resources

- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - Mozilla was helpful when looking for everything CSS and form related.
- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com) - This website helped me for the transitions that i was working on.
